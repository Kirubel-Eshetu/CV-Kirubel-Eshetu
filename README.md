# CV_Kirubel_React
🌟  I implemented my CV in a webpage and made it accessible on the internet for recruiters.

## Technologies Used
1️⃣ at first I have used HTML and CSS. <br />
2️⃣ Once I have learnt React, I changed the stack to React.
🚀 Deployments and updates will be on the React.

## Article before developing the webpage
🔙 Developing my Curriculum Vitae as a website using HTML and CSS. After developing the website the plan is to host it on the Internet. 

# Article after the completion of the task
⏭️ The final masterpiece of the webpage is done using HTML and CSS. It took a bunch of HTML and CSS lines of code to complete the project (since they are constantly evolving, I can't state how many lines 😁). <br />
⏭️ I have tried to make the website responsive for different viewports. It is a simple and basic carriculum vitae with no additional linked pages apart from the homepage. Give it a look!

❤️ As promised before completing the task, I have hosted the webpage. Didn't know hosting was very easy on Vercel (before trying it out, of course). 😁😁😁

✨ After that, I have changed the website into React for better understanding of the framework and to make it easier for managment of the page.
